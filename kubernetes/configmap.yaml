  # This is a placeholder. In a real deployment, you would:
  # 1. Either reference an existing PVC with the dataset
  # 2. Or load the dataset into the ConfigMap (for small datasets)
  # 3. Or use a shared storage solution like NFS
  # For now, we'll create a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual dataset

    # This will be replaced with the actual dataset content
    # For large datasets, use a PersistentVolume instead
